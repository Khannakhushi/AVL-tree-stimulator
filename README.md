# AVL-tree-stimulator

I've constructed an AVL tree simulator, a versatile data structure known for its self-balancing properties. This simulator encompasses a suite of fundamental operations crucial for AVL tree management, enabling real-time data manipulation with optimal efficiency.
My simulator seamlessly handles AVL tree operations such as height updating, left and right rotations, balance factor calculation, level-order printing, and the retrieval of the minimum value.
